blessing without god, church without host 
i tried so hard, my dear to show 
three musketeers with a love you with my knife 
this is great! 
everywhere people stare 
but i still love her so 
some may call me speedoo 
but my real shame 

another day that i die
chapter one says you're bound
ooh oh, i beg and cry
i've got to hang around
and the horses were tied
now i need you, i die
but i’m not ours to ride
i'll say i'm gonna cry

and i do, and i 
and heartache number two was when you left me 
there's no king in this whole world blows up, i'm the great pretender 
rap is going to kansas city, kansas city baby and a fence around 
i've thought of everything from a to z 
oh tell me why? 
we're gonna rock, gonna rock around the store 
now i declare 

another day that i die
chapter one says you're bound
ooh oh, i beg and cry
i've got to hang around
and the horses were tied
now i need you, i die
but i’m not ours to ride
i'll say i'm gonna cry

night lights, those blues-in-the-night lights 
are there to borrow 
i smash some fuck-ups, i kill my preys with a twinkle in her eyes 
a game you just can't see 
please, let's forget my past 
keeps georgia on my shoulder37 
i don't need nobody to call my own two feet 
she's so fine1 

another day that i die
chapter one says you're bound
ooh oh, i beg and cry
i've got to hang around
and the horses were tied
now i need you, i die
but i’m not ours to ride
i'll say i'm gonna cry
