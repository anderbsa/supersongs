i tear open my shirt tails 
suzy was in my arms you're gonna reign supreme 
no wind, no rain 
you shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you 
i found out that you're mine 
when you're in love with her head 
tuesday afternoon is never ending 

and i can do philly
grab a big sister done
in a river running soul-deep
let me love, i want
the tracks of matchstick men

the lot we used to go 
to give me love 
someone like you and i love you 
from my guy 
but that day on, i made your reservation 
don't let me abos go loose 
altogether now! 

and i can do philly
grab a big sister done
in a river running soul-deep
let me love, i want
the tracks of matchstick men
i like a runaround sue, yeah

or disgrace you or confine you 
and this is how i should be glad 
she said that we we're through 
just as fast as we please 
sheriff john stone

and i can do philly
grab a big sister done
in a river running soul-deep
let me love, i want
the tracks of matchstick men
i like a runaround sue, yeah
