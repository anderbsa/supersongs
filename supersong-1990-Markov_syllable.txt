i wanna break it down 
i wasn't with it 
so just let it fade 
now you've disappeared somewhere 
we can't have that 
or maybe i am forsaking all the way, just tell the ballers cuz they bell wearing gazelles 
and you know you could've been some money 
hundred-dollar bills, y'all 

to justify my heart16
it's like that, that yeah, ooh
when you're horny, let's get, let's go
help me sugar sugar
it's not forgive me follow
who rocks you want to do bad boys

it won't stop, i won't come down, i keep away from a white man scared, from a poor family 
never miss what you got, babe 
i want it to me 
i knew i had the brew, she had the chronic 
the original rump shakers 
shorty swing my way 
unashamed of the night 
how can we straighten it out? 

to justify my heart16
it's like that, that yeah, ooh
when you're horny, let's get, let's go
help me sugar sugar
it's not forgive me follow
who rocks you want to do bad boys

and you can't explain 
a new recreation 
to the fly girls, and bust your butts 
girl i want to be rolling in my life 
never gonna leave, never gonna end 
well there's nothing i wouldn't waste my time on you since then 
a car was stalled, the engine was dead 
ain't from the rest of the aura 

to justify my heart16
it's like that, that yeah, ooh
when you're horny, let's get, let's go
help me sugar sugar
it's not forgive me follow
who rocks you want to do bad boys
