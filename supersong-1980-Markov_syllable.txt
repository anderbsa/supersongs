i can only see your ship go sailing 
when i think you've pulled one over on me 
figures up ahead moving in the bar 
and the world's gone home 
ain't that a boy 
you know that you're having my baby 
don't wanna be there 
in me 

in a wishing well you
is by one does it slow
give me right through the church of town
it's a lonely heart
sowing the firelight
ooh, heaven and lonely nights

so take your place 
if i fall 
on a hot summer night 
to love you want me, let me be your joker man 
so let me introduce myself 
loving you's the harder part on the pages in-between 
slipped me notes under the moonlight, this serious moonlight 
with your arms tonight 

in a wishing well you
is by one does it slow
give me right through the church of town
it's a lonely heart
sowing the firelight
ooh, heaven and lonely nights

i said they rule my world, i said 
he was six-foot-four and full of promises that you do to you, tonight 
let's do it, batman 
batman 
batman 
oh i just feel so cold, and i live 
i'll ruin everything you are here 
and did you get some man que quiera get some relief 

in a wishing well you
is by one does it slow
give me right through the church of town
it's a lonely heart
sowing the firelight
ooh, heaven and lonely nights
