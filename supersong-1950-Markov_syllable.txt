number forty-seven said to number three was when you came back but never meant to stay 
with hopeful heart i pray 
that he was meant for me 
tell your mama, tell your friend there with you 
remember how you used to carry his guitar in a cold, cold heart 
for who knows when 
when will i be? 
someday he will see 

hey, shh, just to the sound
if your head, tom dooley
my heart is what do the chain, gang
each night i'll be loved
go johnny go go, go
you load sixteen tons, what a dream

well it says so in love with you, busting shots from your sweet helping hand 
i can 
i can't get over how she set me free 
oh lonesome me 
true love, true love 
when you're gone, yet i'll dream 
don't know much about the night 
oh well i love you with all my heart can't forget 

hey, shh, just to the sound
if your head, tom dooley
my heart is what do the chain, gang
each night i'll be loved
go johnny go go, go
you load sixteen tons, what a dream

you'll never be free dear but when i'm with you 
hide in the paper there are robbers arf, arf 
with your sweet lips a little while 
to know, know, know him 
i'd welcome her right back here in my eyes 
and the dancing bug 
there stood a log cabin made of earth and wood 
where the rabbit couldn't go 

hey, shh, just to the sound
if your head, tom dooley
my heart is what do the chain, gang
each night i'll be loved
go johnny go go, go
you load sixteen tons, what a dream
