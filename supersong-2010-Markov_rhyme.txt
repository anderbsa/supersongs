they say, oh my god, that's my song 
where have you living life like superman 
nothing to say, things that i've been reading books of old 
whenever you call baby i roll up the numbers on you 
so if i can't move a thing 
see, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front door 
yeah, he found a six-shooter gun 
rollie all on my ice just like tennis 

have i wanna wake up
bust down, take you make me
i'm-i'm a lot of your cup
oh baby, if i'll be
no scars to love, how
you’re singing in the phone
eye to the bottom, now
before i don't wake me alone

do i look into your eyes 
you know what i'm puffin', og 
and even sometimes he would go away too 
well, i found a girl, beautiful and stay forever young 
keep our clothes on the plane nigga 
no words can explain the way tonight 
when they thought that i've been keeping to myself 
hold on, to me like this 

have i wanna wake up
bust down, take you make me
i'm-i'm a lot of your cup
oh baby, if i'll be
no scars to love, how
you’re singing in the phone
eye to the bottom, now
before i don't wake me alone

top down on it, yeah 
i see 
the way that you will never have 
nigga with attitude and your body close 
when the morning left 
fat cookie blunt in the hills, yeah 
girl, look at you for me 
the game is off balance, i'm back in the middle of june 

have i wanna wake up
bust down, take you make me
i'm-i'm a lot of your cup
oh baby, if i'll be
no scars to love, how
you’re singing in the phone
eye to the bottom, now
before i don't wake me alone
