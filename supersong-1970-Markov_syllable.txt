guess mine is his 
i still was a tent show queen 
oh yeah 
we had to say 
that i really must confess right here where you should go away 
crying like a wave she came 
hit it! 
got the wings stop 

i was a killer queen
don't you laying in a run
tell me across the love to her
take my girl we've learned?
feel like the fires blaze
but the lights, sweet city woman

is the answer to 
me for you baby 
although the things that pass for knowledge 
i grab my pillow in the back of a lifetime 
she comes down from yellow mountain 
on blue bayou 
gonna put it in the morning, look in your way 
and i'll be missing you 

i was a killer queen
don't you laying in a run
tell me across the love to her
take my girl we've learned?
feel like the fires blaze
but the lights, sweet city woman

tell me why? 
mmm, just a little luck, a little more than feelings 
whoa, oh-uh-oh, oh-oh 
i leave it there, afraid of a river beginning to flow 
met a boy just south of mobile 
gave him a little of both 
and we gotta take care 
yeah baby 

i was a killer queen
don't you laying in a run
tell me across the love to her
take my girl we've learned?
feel like the fires blaze
but the lights, sweet city woman
