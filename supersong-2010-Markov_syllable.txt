hear those magic reindeer click 
oh, angel sent from up above 
all these other girls are tempting 
but i will but i couldn't stay away, i couldn't fight it 
bitch, i'm a dog, eat my treat hrr 
hop out the bottle, i got my back 
just like i can be your best friend, and you ain't know existed yeah 
en cuba, la cosa está dura 

we're beautiful, like me
don't come on breathin', mmm-mmm
and i get a l, but you alive
so i love with no time
i ever stop me cry
god is no better run, but here

anything you want, what you really fake 
you can turn them inside out, i don't know how long it'll take me away 
pulling away from you? oh, yeah 
they think i'm dumb dumb 
they always wanna come, but they just left 
to move to a hater’s ribcage! 
and i'll be the quote 
i'm proud of who i am 

we're beautiful, like me
don't come on breathin', mmm-mmm
and i get a l, but you alive
so i love with no time
i ever stop me cry
god is no better run, but here

when i met you in advance, i don't believe it, we all gonna stunt 
send a prayer to the radio play, and i'm lil dicky in my face 
and now i got her and me together, nothing is better 
baby, just to wake up with some other girl 
for a big benz, not another fan 
if you wanted me then you get a hundred thousand in my house 
the mountain top, walk on by, girls be looking like, damn, he fly 
i can't change 

we're beautiful, like me
don't come on breathin', mmm-mmm
and i get a l, but you alive
so i love with no time
i ever stop me cry
god is no better run, but here
